# Alcohol Detection With Ignition Lock System

## 🔒 Overview
This project is designed to enhance vehicle safety by preventing drunk driving. It uses an alcohol sensor to detect the driver's breath. If alcohol is detected beyond a set threshold, the system automatically disables the ignition, ensuring safe and responsible driving.

## ⚙️ Features
- Alcohol detection using sensor (MQ-3 or similar).
- Automatic ignition lock when alcohol is detected.
- Real-time monitoring of driver condition.
- Compact and cost-effective hardware implementation.
- Helps prevent accidents caused by drunk driving.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Components
- **Hardware**: Arduino/ESP32, MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor, Relay Module, Ignition Lock Circuit, Buzzer/LED.
- **Software**: Arduino IDE (C/C++).
- **Power Supply**: 12V DC (Vehicle-compatible).

## 🚗 Working Principle
1. The alcohol sensor constantly monitors the driver's breath.
2. If the alcohol level exceeds the threshold, the ignition lock is engaged.
3. Buzzer/LED alerts indicate detection.
4. Vehicle ignition remains locked until a safe breath sample is detected.
